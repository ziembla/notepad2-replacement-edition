The Notepad2 Source Code

  This package contains the full source code of Notepad2 4.2.25 for
  Windows. Project files for Visual C++ 7.0 are included. Chances are
  that Notepad2 can be rebuilt with other development tools, including
  the free Visual C++ Express Edition, but I haven't tested this.


Rebuilding from the Source Code

  Notepad2 4.2.25 is based on Scintilla 2.24 [1].

  [1] http://www.scintilla.org

  To be able to rebuild Notepad2, the source code of the Scintilla
  editing component has to be unzipped to the "scintilla" subdirectory
  of the Notepad2 source code directory.

  Many of the Scintilla lexing modules are not used by Notepad2. Run
  LinkLex.js to adapt the list (in "scintilla/src/Catalogue.cxx") and
  make linking work properly.


Creating a Compact Executable Program File

  Linking to the system CRT slightly improves disk footprint, memory
  usage and startup because the pages for the system CRT are already
  loaded and shared in memory. To achieve this, the release version of
  Notepad2.exe is built using the Windows Driver Kit (WDK) 7.1.0 tools,
  available as a free download from Microsoft. The appropriate build
  scripts can be found in the "wdkbuild" subdirectory. Set %WDKBASEDIR%
  to the directory of the WDK tools on your system.


How to add or modify Syntax Schemes

  The Scintilla documentation has an overview of syntax highlighting,
  and how to write your own lexing module, in case the language you
  would like to add is not currently supported by Scintilla.

  Add your own lexer data structs to the global pLexArray (Styles.c),
  then adjust NUMLEXERS (Styles.h) to the new total number of syntax
  schemes. Include the "scintilla/lexers/Lex*.cxx" file required for
  your language into your project. Ensure the new module is initialized
  (in "scintilla/src/Catalogue.cxx"), either by manually uncommenting
  the corresponding LINK_LEXER() macro call, or by updating and
  re-running LinkLex.js.
